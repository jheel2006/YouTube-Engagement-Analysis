# YouTube Engagement Analysis

This project analyzes whether video length predicts engagement on YouTube by comparing like-to-view ratios for short videos (under 10 minutes) and long videos (over 20 minutes).

Using data collected from 221 videos across Gaming, Music, How-to & Style, and Science & Technology, the analysis finds that short videos generally receive significantly higher proportional engagement, with category-specific exceptions.
